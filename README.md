## 🚗 Project Description

This project is a **License Plate Recognition and Color Detection System** built with **YOLOv5** and **Tesseract OCR**, deployed via a **Streamlit web application**.

The system can:

* 🧠 Detect vehicle **license plates** from uploaded images.
* 🔠 Recognize and extract **alphanumeric text** using **OCR**.
* 🎨 Determine the **color of the plate** (Black / White) automatically.

This is useful for **vehicle identification**, **traffic analysis**, and **parking management** systems.
